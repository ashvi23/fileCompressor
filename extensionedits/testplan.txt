Testplan:

Part I: Valid Cases
1. All control characters.
2. One word files with no delimeters
3. control codes are written '\' 'n'
4. A small paragraph from a book
5. Non .txt files
6. Repetition of tokens
7. Files containing tokens that all have the same frequency
8. 
9.
10.


Part II: Invalid Cases
1. When compressing/decompressing - a word/code does not exist in the codebook
2. Attempt to decompress a non .hcz file
3. Attempt to recursively perform a command on a single file
4. Attempt to recursively perform a command on an empty file
5. Attempt to decompress a file that contains characters other than ones/zeros


Part III: Time Complexity
1. Recursion on a lot of directories and files but each of them only has a few token per file
2. Same as above but this time one of the files returns an error while:
    A. Recursing -Empty file, directory with no open permission, dead end folder recursions
    B. Buildcodebook - Doesn't have permission to open a file, ran out of space
    C. Compress - One of the tokens is not in the codebook.
    D. Decompress - Compressed file contains invalid tokens.

Part IV: Time and Space Complexity
1. 50,000 word file
2. Mixture of small and big files (1k - 40k)
